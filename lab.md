> We study bacteria, the simplest free-living single-celled organisms. 
We are interested in how they sense changes in their environment, analyze sensory data, and respond in a purposeful manner. 
Our quest is an understanding of behavior at the molecular level, especially behavior involving chemical stimuli (chemotaxis). 
Our primary subject is the peritrichously-flagellated bacterium Escherichia coli, that lives in your gut. 
We are trying to learn how its flagellar motors work, how their directions of rotation are controlled by the cell's sensory-transduction network, 
and what effect that rotation has on modes of flagellar propulsion.
Our main interest is free-swimming cells, 
but we also study cells that swarm (swim in a coordinated manner over moist surfaces), or twitch (Pseudomonas) or glide (Cytophaga, Flavobacterium, Mycoplasma).
